# ROC-GLM and Calibration for DataSHIELD


The package provides functionality to conduct and visualize ROC analysis and calibration on decentralized data. The basis is the [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/) infrastructure for distributed computing. This package provides the calculation of the [**ROC-GLM**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676973?seq=1) with [**AUC confidence intervals**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2531595?seq=1) as well as [**calibration curves**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calibration-curves/) and the [**Brier score**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score). In order to calculate the ROC-GLM or assess calibration it is necessary to push models and predict them at the servers which is also provided by this package. Note that DataSHIELD uses [privacy filter](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/pages/714768398/Disclosure+control) from DataSHIELD v5 onwards that are also used in this package. Additionally, this package uses the old option `datashield.privacyLevel` (to indicate the minimal amount of values required to allow sharing an aggregation) as fallback. Instead of setting the option, we directly retrieve the fallback privacy level from the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file each time a function calls for it. This options is set to 5 by default. The methodology of the package is explained in detail [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10828).

## Installation

At the moment, there is no CRAN version available. Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("difuture-lmu/dsBinVal")
```

#### Register methods

It is necessary to register the assign and aggregate methods in the OPAL administration. These methods are registered automatically when publishing the package on OPAL (see [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)).

Note that the package needs to be installed at both locations, the server and the analysts machine.

## Installation on DataSHIELD

The two options are to use the Opal API:

- Log into Opal ans switch to the `Administration/DataSHIELD/` tab
- Click the `Add DataSHIELD package` button
- Select `GitHub` as source, and use `difuture-lmu` as user, `dsBinVal` as name, and `main` as Git reference.

The second option is to use the `opalr` package to install `dsBinVal` directly from `R`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
### User credentials (here from the opal test server):
surl     = "https://opal-demo.obiba.org/"
username = "administrator"
password = "password"

### Install package and publish methods:
opal = opalr::opal.login(username = username, password = password, url = surl)

opalr::dsadmin.install_github_package(opal = opal, pkg = "dsBinVal", username = "difuture-lmu", ref = "main")
opalr::dsadmin.publish_package(opal = opal, pkg = "dsBinVal")

opalr::opal.logout(opal)
```

## Usage

A more sophisticated example is available [here](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/datashield-roc-glm-demo).

```{r}
library(dsBinVal)
```

#### Log into DataSHIELD server

```{r}
builder = newDSLoginBuilder()

surl     = "https://opal-demo.obiba.org/"
username = "administrator"
password = "password"

builder$append(
  server   = "ds1",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM1"
)
builder$append(
  server   = "ds2",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM2"
)
builder$append(
  server   = "ds3",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM3"
)

connections = datashield.login(logins = builder$build(), assign = TRUE)
```

#### Load test model, push to DataSHIELD, and calculate predictions

```{r}
# Load the model fitted locally on CNSIM:
load(here::here("Readme_files/mod.rda"))
# Model was calculated by:
#> glm(DIS_DIAB ~ ., data = CNSIM, family = binomial())

# Push the model to the DataSHIELD servers:
pushObject(connections, mod)

# Create a clean data set without NAs:
ds.completeCases("D", newobj = "D_complete")

# Calculate scores and save at the servers:
pfun =  "predict(mod, newdata = D, type = 'response')"
predictModel(connections, mod, "pred", "D_complete", predict_fun = pfun)

datashield.symbols(connections)
```

#### Calculate l2-sensitivity

```{r}
# In order to securely calculate the ROC-GLM, we have to assess the
# l2-sensitivity to set the privacy parameters of differential
# privacy adequately:
l2s = dsL2Sens(connections, "D_complete", "pred")
l2s

# Due to the results presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10828, we set the privacy parameters to
# - epsilon = 0.2, delta = 0.1 if        l2s <= 0.01
# - epsilon = 0.3, delta = 0.4 if 0.01 < l2s <= 0.03
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.3 if 0.03 < l2s <= 0.05
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.5 if 0.05 < l2s <= 0.07
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.5 if 0.07 < l2s BUT results may be not good!
```

#### Calculate ROC-GLM

```{r}
# The response must be encoded as integer/numeric vector:
ds.asInteger("D_complete$DIS_DIAB", "truth")
roc_glm = dsROCGLM(connections, truth_name = "truth", pred_name = "pred",
  dat_name = "D_complete", seed_object = "pred")
roc_glm

plot(roc_glm)
```

#### Assess calibration

```{r}
dsBrierScore(connections, "truth", "pred")

### Calculate and plot calibration curve:
cc = dsCalibrationCurve(connections, "truth", "pred")
cc

plot(cc)
```

## Deploy information:

__Build by `r Sys.info()[["login"]]` (`r Sys.info()[["sysname"]]`) on `r as.character(Sys.time())`.__

This readme is built automatically after each push to the repository and weekly on Monday. The autobuilt is computed by installing the package on the DataSHIELD test server and is therefore a test if the functionality of the package works on DataSHIELD servers. Additionally, the functionality is tested using the [GH Actions](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) with [`tests/testthat/test_on_active_server.R`](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/blob/main/tests/testthat/test_on_active_server.R). The system information of the local and remote machines are:


```{r, include=FALSE}
ri_l  = sessionInfo()
ri_ds = datashield.aggregate(connections, quote(getDataSHIELDInfo()))
client_pkgs = c("DSI", "DSOpal", "dsBaseClient", "dsBinVal")
remote_pkgs = c("dsBase", "resourcer", "dsBinVal")
```

- Local machine:
    - `R` version: `r ri_l$R.version$version.string`
    - Version of DataSHELD client packages:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
dfv = installed.packages()[client_pkgs, ]
dfv = data.frame(Package = rownames(dfv), Version = unname(dfv[, "Version"]))
knitr::kable(dfv)
```

- Remote DataSHIELD machines:
    - OPAL version of the test instance: `r opal_version`
    - `R` version of `r names(ri_ds)[1]`: `r ri_ds[[1]]$session$R.version$version.string`
    - `R` version of `r names(ri_ds)[2]`: `r ri_ds[[2]]$session$R.version$version.string`
    - Version of server packages:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
dfv = do.call(cbind, lapply(names(ri_ds), function(nm) {
  out = ri_ds[[nm]]$pcks[remote_pkgs, "Version", drop = FALSE]
  colnames(out) = paste0(nm, ": ", colnames(out))
  as.data.frame(out)
}))
dfv = cbind(Package = rownames(dfv), dfv)
rownames(dfv) = NULL
knitr::kable(dfv)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
datashield.logout(connections)
```
